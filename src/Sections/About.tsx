                Hi, I'm Sunny Kumar
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
                I am a passionate and driven <strong>SDE (Frontend)</strong> specializing in <strong>React.js</strong>,
                <strong> API Integration</strong>, and <strong>UI/UX design</strong>. With hands-on experience in building
                <strong> dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications</strong>,
                I focus on creating seamless, high-performing solutions that engage users and deliver exceptional experiences across all devices.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
                My journey into the tech world started with a deep curiosity about programming,
                which has evolved into a career dedicated to crafting intuitive user interfaces.
                Through <strong>multiple internships</strong> and <strong>real-world projects</strong>,
                I've gained expertise in both <strong>frontend development</strong> and <strong>WordPress</strong>.
                My skill set includes <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Material-UI</strong>,
                <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>API handling</strong>,
                enabling me to create responsive and scalable applications.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
                I have successfully collaborated with backend developers to integrate APIs,
                manage application state with tools like <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>Context API</strong>,
                and implement role-based access control. This experience, along with my ability to
                <strong> troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and work in Agile environments</strong>,
                has honed my problem-solving and teamwork skills, allowing me to deliver high-quality products that meet client needs.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
                In addition to frontend development, I have a solid background in <strong>WordPress</strong>,
                from building custom themes and plugins to enhancing site functionality with third-party API integrations.
                Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and continuously pushing the boundaries of web development.
                Whether it's <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>,
                or the latest tools in web design, I'm always excited to explore new frontiers in tech.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
                I believe in writing <strong>clean, efficient code</strong>,
                <strong> solving problems creatively</strong>, and <strong>focusing on user-centric designs</strong>.
                Communication and collaboration are key to delivering successful projects, and I thrive in fast-paced,
                collaborative environments where I can quickly adapt and contribute to innovative solutions.
