              My journey into the tech world started with a deep curiosity about programming, which has evolved into a career dedicated to crafting intuitive user interfaces.

              I have successfully collaborated with backend developers to integrate APIs, manage application state with tools like <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>Context API</strong>, and implement role-based access control.
